# GettingAndCleaningDataProject
Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repository contains "final" project for the "Getting and Cleaning Data" course.

The purpose of the project was to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal was to prepare a tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

The raw data for the project has been obtained from the [UCI HAR Dataset](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).

## Repository content
[README.md](README.md) - this file. As per project's assignment, it explains the content of the repository and the purpose of each file.

[CodeBook.md](CodeBook.md) - is a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that have been performed to clean up the data

[run_analysis.R](run_analysis.R) - the main script for the project (written in R) that performs the following tasks:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

[tidyDataSet.csv](tidyDataSet.csv) - the new tidy data set satisfying all the requirements of the assignment (independent, tidy, with average of each variable for each activity and each subject)
